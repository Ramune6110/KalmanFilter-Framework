# KalmanFilter-Framework

This Matlab code is the framework that applies Liner Kalman Filter
to SISO System and MIMO System.

# State Estimation
## SISO System

![State Estimation SISO System](https://github.com/Ramune6110/KalmanFilter-Framework/blob/master/KalmanFilter_Framework_SISO.png)

## MIMO System

# Features

This code is written in Object-Oriented programming, not structured programming.  
Furthermore, the present invention can be applied to various systems only by changing the system matrix.

# Requirement

* MATLAB

# Usage

You can reproduce State Estimation by cloning the code and executing 
KalmanFilter_SISO_System and KalmanFilter_MIMO_System.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ramune6110/KalmanFilter-Framework.git
```

# Note

I don't test environments under Linux and Mac.
